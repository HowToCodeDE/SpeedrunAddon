# SpeedrunAddon
An addon for Stopwatch Plugin to make an automation for speedruns.

I made a little Speedrun Plugin for Spigot. It will automatically starts a stopwatch when a player joins the server and stop when the ender dragon is killed. It is based on Stopwatch, a simple stopwatch/timer which displays the time to the hotbar with customizable messages.
